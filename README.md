  Introduction to ML using the Iris dataset... because yes... one of the classic datasets in ML is about Iris flowers...
  as background it is a total of 150 samples of 3 types of Iris flowers. It is used as a standard ML learning dataset since
  it is small, well studied, and balanced.

  Second pass at basic ML pipeline, only real difference is that data needs to be standardized/scaled/normalized in order to make it
  more usable to ML algorithims. I used scaling in this demo, but depending on the algorithims you want to test different methods
  will have different effects so you should feel free to test them out
  
  The goal in this dataset is to predict whether or not someone will have diabetes within 5 years based on a series of metrics.
